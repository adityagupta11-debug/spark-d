# Firebase Setup Guide

Your Firebase integration is now complete! Here's what has been set up:

## ✅ What's Working

1. **Firebase Authentication**
   - Email/password sign up and sign in
   - ASU email validation (must end with @asu.edu)
   - Email verification
   - User profile creation in Firestore

2. **Firestore Database**
   - User profiles stored with all form data
   - Real-time user state management
   - Secure data structure

3. **React Integration**
   - Authentication context for global state
   - Protected routes and user sessions
   - Loading states and error handling

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the sign-up flow:**
   - Fill out the multi-step form
   - Use an ASU email address (ends with @asu.edu)
   - Check your email for verification

3. **Test the sign-in flow:**
   - Use the same credentials you signed up with
   - You'll be redirected to a dashboard

## 🔧 Firebase Console Setup

Make sure your Firebase project has these services enabled:

1. **Authentication**
   - Go to Firebase Console > Authentication > Sign-in method
   - Enable "Email/Password" provider

2. **Firestore Database**
   - Go to Firebase Console > Firestore Database
   - Create database in production mode
   - Set up security rules (see below)

## 🔒 Security Rules

Add these Firestore security rules in the Firebase Console:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only read/write their own profile
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## 🌍 Environment Variables (Optional)

For production, create a `.env.local` file:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.firebasestorage.app
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
```
